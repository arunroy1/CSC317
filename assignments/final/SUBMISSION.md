Submission Reflection

Working on Recipe Explorer has been a great learning experience, especially around styling and user authentication. Here’s a quick look at what I focused on and learned:

CSS & Visual Design

Brand Consistency: I experimented with color palettes, typography (using Raleway), and spacing to create a clean, appetizing look that ties the entire site together.

Responsive Layouts: I wrote flexible CSS to ensure forms, recipe cards, and images adapt nicely to different screen sizes—thanks to media queries and fluid units.

User-Friendly Forms: From the signup/login pages to the comment and rating sections, I styled form elements and feedback messages (errors, success states) so users always know what’s happening.

Authentication Features

Sign Up & Log In: Implemented secure password hashing with bcrypt, plus form validation and clear error messages for missing or invalid fields.

Session Management: Learned to configure express-session with connect-mongo to keep users logged in, and protect routes (like Add Recipe and Profile) behind authentication checks.

Profile Menu: Built a dropdown that reveals account details (and a password show/hide toggle), and wired up logout functionality with a confirmation step.

Takeaways

Collaboration: Coordinating merges and pull requests taught me more about Git branching strategies and resolving conflicts.

End-to-End Flow: Seeing how CSS, EJS, Express routes, node.js and MongoDB work together end-to-end gave me a stronger grasp of full-stack development.

User Experience Matters: Small visual cues—hover states, error highlights, loading indicators—make a surprisingly big difference in how comfortable people feel using your app.

I’m proud of what we've made for this project, and I’m excited to keep refining both the look and the behind-the-scenes logic in future iterations.
