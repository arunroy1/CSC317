[Image: Minimalist Graphic Design Portfolio Template]

Please generate a single CSS file that applies a clean, modern aesthetic inspired by the minimalist portfolio reference image. The design should include:

1. A black, white, and yellow color scheme (bold yet minimal).
2. Gradient dividers between sections.
3. A custom scrollbar with accent colors.
4. Mobile-friendly responsive design.
5. Subtle dynamic animations (e.g., fade-in, hover effects).
6. Professional clarity in layout and typography.

Constraints:
- We cannot change the existing HTML or add JavaScript.
- We can only style elements and classes already present in the HTML (body, header, nav, main, section, etc.).
- Use smooth transitions and maintain a sleek, minimal style.

Generate the CSS as if it's for “ai-2.css” without any additional commentary or modifications.
