# AI CSS Generation Prompt

Please generate a complete CSS file for a personal portfolio website with the following specifications:

- **Color Scheme**: Use a modern neutral palette with a primary accent color of blue (`#007bff`), secondary gray (`#6c757d`), and a light background (`#f8f9fa`). Accent elements should use a complementary color (`#ffc107`).

- **Typography**: Use modern sans-serif fonts such as Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif for a clean, professional look. Headings should be bold and slightly larger for clear hierarchy.

- **Layout**:
  - The website includes a header with a profile image and title, a navigation bar, and a main content area with multiple sections (About, Experience, Projects, Skills, Education, and Hobbies).
  - The design should be responsive, including grid layouts for sections like project cards and experience cards.
  - The layout should offer ample white space and a minimalistic design to keep the content clear and engaging.

- **Design Elements**:
  - Include subtle box shadows and rounded corners on cards and interactive elements to enhance the modern feel.
  - Apply smooth hover effects on navigation links and cards for better interactivity.
  - The theme switcher widget should be styled as a fixed element in the bottom-right corner, featuring modern box shadows, rounded corners, and a clear visual state for active selections.

Ensure that the CSS is consistent, accessible, and optimized for responsiveness across different devices. Thank you.
