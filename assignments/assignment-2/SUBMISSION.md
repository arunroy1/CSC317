##  HTML Personal Portfolio Website Assignment
        
### Description:
The objective of this assignment was to create a personal portfolio website using HTML. The key tasks involved designing a well-structured web page that showcases personal information, education, experience, projects, and skills. This assignment also emphasized the importance of semantic HTML, accessibility, and clean code organization.
        
## Approach / What I Did:
To build this portfolio website, I structured the HTML with semantic elements such as header, nav, main, and footer. The content was organized into clearly defined sections, making navigations. I included an image for a profile picture, used an ordered list for the navigation menu, and incorporated a responsive design approach to ensure compatibility across different devices. Additionally, I embedded a sample YouTube video that i created to showcase how I used iframe.
        
## Code Explanation:
Below is a snippet of the HTML code that structures the portfolio website:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Arun Roy - Portfolio</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Arun Roy</h1>
        <p>Computer Science Major at SFSU</p>
    </header>
    <nav>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Arun Roy, a Computer Science major at San Francisco State University. My passion for software development stems from a deep curiosity about how applications are built and function. I am continuously working to enhance my coding skills by taking university courses as well as online programs through platforms like Coursera. Beyond academics, I have a strong interest in outdoor activities, particularly tennis, badminton, and soccer. I am actively seeking Summer 2025 internship opportunities where I can apply my technical knowledge, collaborate on impactful projects, and further develop as a software developer.</p>

This snippet represents the essential structure of my portfolio website, including a header, navigation, and an 'About Me' section. Additional elements such as an experience section, project highlights, and contact information were added too.
