        <h2>HTML Personal Portfolio Website Assignment</h2>
        
        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>The objective of this assignment was to create a personal portfolio website using HTML. The key tasks involved designing a well-structured web page that showcases personal information, education, experience, projects, and skills. This assignment also emphasized the importance of semantic HTML, accessibility, and clean code organization.</p>
        
        <h3>Approach / What I Did:</h3>
        <p>To build this portfolio website, I structured the HTML with semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer>. The content was organized into clearly defined sections, making navigation intuitive. I included an image for a profile picture, used an ordered list for the navigation menu, and incorporated a responsive design approach to ensure compatibility across different devices. Additionally, I embedded a YouTube video relevant to my field of study and included an external link to my GitHub profile.</p>
        
        <h3>Code Explanation:</h3>
        <p>Below is a snippet of the HTML code that structures the portfolio website:</p>
